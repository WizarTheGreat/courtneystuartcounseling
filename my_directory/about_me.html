Hi. Or should that be g’day? <br> <br>
My accent will probably give it away where I am from when you talk to me, but  I’ve lived in Canada for twenty years, so I guess you could say I’m part of the furniture now. <br>
I've known from an early age that I wanted to be of service to people and in general, my life path has followed this route. I’ve been a school teacher, a social worker, ordained minister of religion and now a qualified life coach and a therapeutic counsellor. <br>
 In a few months I will add death doula to the list of services I will offer to the people of my community.  <br>
Life hasn't always been a bowl of cherries for me. I've dealt with unexplained infertility, cancer, heart disease, escaping an abusive marriage, immigration, divorce, single parenthood, homelessness, and mental health issues. <br>
Through it all, faith has carried me, and so here I am, hoping to be of service to you. <br>
I love all things sparkly (working in a jewelry store was the best retail experience of my life. <br> 
"Courtney, step away from the gemstones!") pink is my signature colour, I am a confirmed bookworm and story writer, documentary and movie specialist, I consider chocolate a major food group and wearing dresses is my thing. <br>
